## Personal statement

As I embark on my security journey, my primary goals are to gain a woman's perspective in the cybersecurity field, insights on transitioning to a security career, and guidance on developing technical skills. Additionally, I'm eager to learn about security trends and receive valuable career advice. I'm seeking a role that's mentally stimulating and values my curiosity and problem-solving abilities.

I have a 15-year career as a technical writer; the past 4 years have been with AWS. I've been on two AWS teams: WWPS capture and proposal team and the OpenSearch open source project. I've written on a variety of technical topics, including technical approaches and solutions, end user guides, tutorials, and software documentation. I aim to leverage my technical communication skills in this transition. 

Over the past couple years, I've developed an interest in cybersecurity. This year, I've dedicated time to my professional development by enrolling in the Google Cybersecurity certification and joining WiCyS. I've recently applied to a second-bachelor cybersecurity program at CU Denver; I have a master's degree (non-tech).Â I'm particularly drawn to risk management and compliance or threat intelligence. However, as a mid-level professional and mother navigating a career change, I'm still exploring the security domains and assessing which ones align with my capabilities and aspirations.
