## Personal statement

I’m currently transitioning my career into the cybersecurity field, and I would appreciate the opportunity to have you as a mentor during this exciting journey.

With 12 years of experience as a technical writer, I have developed a firm foundation in technical communication and documentation. However, I'm now seeking to leverage my skills in a new domain—-cybersecurity. To prepare for this transition, I have been actively pursuing certifications, including the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity, which I'm currently completing, and the Google Cybersecurity certifications, which I'll be starting soon.

As a mid-career professional, I understand the value of having a knowledgeable mentor to guide me through this career change. Your expertise and insights in the cybersecurity field would be invaluable in helping me navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
If you're open to the idea of being my mentor, I would be honored to learn from your experiences and benefit from your guidance. I'm committed to putting in the hard work and dedication required to succeed in this new field, and I believe that having a mentor like you would greatly enhance my chances of success.

Thank you for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of working with you and learning from your expertise.
